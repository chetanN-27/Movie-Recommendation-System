MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

A content based movie recommender system using Machine learning. I've used  k-nearest neighbors algorithm in this project. The function used from the sklearn is cosine 
similarity which dettermines how similar or different two sets of items are and use it to determine the classification.
